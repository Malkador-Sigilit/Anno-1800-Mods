Increases the passive Trade budget from AI merchants and opponents (5k to 100k).

Right now, as of game version 9.0, the Budget for AI merchants is bugged, only the first (EarlyGame) value is ever used, so I set it fixed to 50k.
Furthermore the merchants may buy/sell everything from AI, so there is nothing left for the player. I recommend my More Passive Trade Budget + mod to prevent this.

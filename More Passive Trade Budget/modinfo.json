      "Chinese": "Right now, as of game version 9.0, the Budget for AI merchants is bugged, only the first (EarlyGame) value is ever used, so I set it fixed to 50k for now. \nFurthermore the merchants may buy/sell everything from AI, so there is nothing left for the player. I recommend my More Passive Trade Budget + mod to prevent this.",

      "German": "Leider ist das Spiel diesbezüglich noch verbuggt (game version 9.0), sodass nur der EarlyGame definierte Wert das ganze Spiel über von Händlern verwendet wird. Daher beträgt dieser Wert, bis das gefixt ist, das ganze Spiel über 50k. \nAußerdem kaufen Händler bei hohem Budget bei der KI eventuell alles auf, sodass der Spieler dort nichts mehr kaufen/verkaufen kann, ich empfehle für Spiele mit KI Mitspielern also die More Passive Trade Budget + Variante.",

1.01:
- changed folder name to zzBlueprints, so it loads after most other mods, to be able to make blueprints for mod buildings.
- Added Support for my mods: Small Powerplant and Kaiserdom. Now you can also place blueprints of them.
- Added Steam Shipyard.
1.02:
Added blueprints for Silo and Tractor modules, so you can plan a bit ahead. The blueprints do not change the required fields for farms (use shift instead to be able to place more fields than allowed, if you want to plan with more fields).

Stronger Pirates:
Pirate Towers ~ 30% more damage and 50% more hitpoints.
Doubled hitpoints and damage from Pirate Big Gun.
30k Hitpoints for Pirate harbour, and it is more relevant to moral of island.

Pirates will have ~5 more ships in each phase and also more of higher tier.
They will come back every 60 minutes (instead of 150) with quite big fleet (latemidgame with 10 Ships of Line) and will repair their base 5 minutes after combat.
Only 10 minutes instead of 30 to defeat the pirate fleet, before they settle again.

Cease Fire will only last 45 minutes, instead of 180 (also for 2nd Party)
And Non Attack Agreement lasts 90 minutes instead of 4 hours. (also for 2nd Party)

Unlocks the Frigate in shipyard at same time like gunboat, so you have bit better chance in the EarlyMidGame against Pirates.

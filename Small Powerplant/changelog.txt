1.01
- Added the small powerplant to several triggers/Items/Effects where the game also uses the normal powerplant, to make the small one affected by the same effects.
1.02
- Made savegame compatible (building should unlock even if you you already had powerplants unlocked in savegame)
- This also means a one time savegame compatibilty break! Don't update if you already built the small powerplant in your savegame!

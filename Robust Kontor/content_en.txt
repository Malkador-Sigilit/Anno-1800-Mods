Increases the hitpoints of a kontor from 9000 to (26k,28k,30k,32k (32k is maximum because of integer overflow)) and the MoralPower from 200 to 300.
In addition higher tier kontors will do higher damage (125/150/175/200).
This way it will also take longer to decrease the moral of this island, when it is attacked.
So you have more time to move your ships to defend the island.

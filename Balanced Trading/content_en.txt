- Adjusts all Baseprices of all Goods to (Maintenance costs of the production chain per product)/0.8. This way you can sell your overproduction at +-0 at merchants, but still have the loss of space and one time building costs.
- All merchants offer everything, if they have it on stock (this is already how passive trade works, but now you can see in their harbour, if they have sth.
- All merchants have a tiny production of all goods from their session. So even if no other player sells them some goods, they will have a tiny stock of everything from their session.
- Added 2-4 new "preferred goods" per merchant, they will pay more for these.
- Reduced the price merchants pay for preferred goods from *3.2 to *1.6 for goods of the same session and (2.4 or 3.2) for goods from another session.
- Reduced the rabatte you get from AI players when trading in their harbour from 0.8/2 to 0.9/1.6.
- Ships cost a bit money to build, and you can sell them for average 1.5 times the total building costs (inculding materials at baseprice)

I recommend my mod:

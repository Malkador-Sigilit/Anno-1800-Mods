Attainments instead of Influence Buffs. Research those buffs with Researchpoints, instead of getting them, when you no longer need them with influence (similar to Honor in Anno 1404). Only exception is the Propaganda buff. You can build a kind of researchbuilding when having workers in the scholar tab. I strongly recommend my mod -Early Research and more-.

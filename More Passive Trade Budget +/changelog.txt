- forked from More Passive Trade Budget to include TradeFleet reduction and 40t capacity for merchant ships to compensate for higher budget.

- Using save GUID range. This also means a one time savegame compatibilty break! Don't update if you already used this mod in your savegame!
1.03:
- Ai Merchants will change ships depending on game progress, since I found a way to remove the old ships (so they will no longer sum up to too many ships, so we can use more different ships, although they only differ in speed)

    "German": "Erhöht das passive Handelsbudget von den Händlern und KI Mitspielern (5k bis 100k) und passt die Handelsflotte an:
Reduziert die TradeFleet massiv auf insg. 3 Schiffe in der alten Welt, 2 in neuer Welt, 2 in Africa und 1 in Rest. Außerdem haben alle Schiffe eine maximale Kapazität von 40 Tonnen (8*5).
Auf diese Weise können durch das höhere Budget auch teurere Waren gehandelt werden, aber durch die Mengenlimitierung kaufen den Händler bei KI Mitspielern dennoch nicht alles weg.",

    "German": "Erhöht das passive Handelsbudget von den Händlern und KI Mitspielern (5k bis 100k) und passt die Handelsflotte an:\nReduziert die TradeFleet massiv auf insg. 3 Schiffe in der alten Welt, 2 in neuer Welt, 2 in Africa und 1 in Rest. Außerdem haben alle Schiffe eine maximale Kapazität von 40 Tonnen (8*5).\nAuf diese Weise können durch das höhere Budget auch teurere Waren gehandelt werden, aber durch die Mengenlimitierung kaufen den Händler bei KI Mitspielern dennoch nicht alles weg.",

      "Chinese": "Right now, as of game version 9.0, the Budget for AI merchants is bugged, only the first (EarlyGame) value is ever used, so I set it fixed to 50k for now.\nOld ships of merchants are never removed, so if using within a savegame, you might get more instead of fewer ships.",

      "German": "Leider ist das Spiel diesbezüglich noch verbuggt (game version 9.0), sodass nur der EarlyGame definierte Wert das ganze Spiel über von Händlern verwendet wird. Daher beträgt dieser Wert, bis das gefixt ist, das ganze Spiel über 50k.\nVeraltete Schiffe der Händler verschwinden nie, in einem Savegame werden es also eher mehr, als weniger Schiffe!",

Makes some low lever researches available with workers in a college building: Items, Move Clay/Oil, Researchkit. Research in college is speed up with workers. Adjusted some researchcosts and times.

Before you unlocked scholars and built the research center (demolish the College), there is no steady source of researchpoints, except:
The donation of items grants a little bit more researchpoints. You also get some researchpoints by advancing and doing quests.

The ResearchCenter still uses Engineers to speed of the research, although it unfortunately displays workers.

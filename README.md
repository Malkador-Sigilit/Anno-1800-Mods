 Mods for Anno 1800

Verwendung mit dem/Use with Anno 1800 Mod Loader: https://github.com/xforce/anno1800-mod-loader/releases

Coming Changes:

- Make Kaiserdom/Small Powerplant savegame compatible.

- Split Balanced Trading into several different mods, to be more modular.
- Balanced Trading combined with More Passiv Budget currently results in AI merchants buying/selling everything from AI players. So nothing is left for the player to buy/sell to AI, and therefore Tradingrights are quite useless currently. I will try to balance this better within the next days.

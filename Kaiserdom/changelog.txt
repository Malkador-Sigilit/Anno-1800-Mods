1.01
- Added custom AI BlockScore for Kaiserdom to hopefully make the AI build it next to their city, without overwriting other important stuff. Not tested.
1.02
- Fixed typo
- Made savegame compatible and now using a safe GUID range (that wont conflict with the game ever)
- This also means a one time savegame compatibilty break! Don't update if you already built the Kaiserdom in your savegame!
